# Startup Project

[My Notes](notes.md)

A startup project for CS 260. This is will be a startup idea, but currently this is only a repository created from a template.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Ideas:
- A simple, user-focused flashcard system. Sign in, allows you to share decks with friends and compare scores. 
- Connection--allows you to search for similar hobbies as those you may have? Allows you to search for people with the same hobbies.
    - Perhaps with music--you can list gernes, and it will connect you to people with similar interests and provide contact info that
    they provide. Then it has links or something for finding shows. Music Genre API?
- Calendar coordinator--allows people to vote on or say what, where, and when they want to do things? Suggests things nearby?
- Sharing recipes--users can add tags and share them (such as simple, one pan, etc)

#### Flashcard Pitch
There are so many applications out there that offer flashcard services, but many provide varied or complexs services. This application instead gives users a simple, direct flashcard service that they can control. They can choose to share these flashcards with friends.


#### Recipe Pitch
Users can write recipes and send them to friends via this website. If they aren't sure what to eat, they can search by tags, such as "hot", "spicy", "cool", "simple", etc. The application can suggest recipes depending on the user's preferences and even the weather (hot for cold weather, cool for hot, etc). This is meant to be used amongst friends and can be used in groups of people who have dietary restrictions.
