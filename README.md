[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch (DRAFT)
Have you ever been unsure of what to make for dinner, and all the recipes online are a bit too out of your skill level? This app allows users can write recipes and share them with friends via this website. Just select what you're in the mood for, your skill level, or even what the weather is, and the application will suggest recipes! This can be used to find recipes for those with dietary restrictions, beginning chefs, or if someone is just not sure what to have for lunch.

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Server
    Actor Bob
    actor Alice
    Alice-->>Server: Alice's Recipe (HOT)
    Server->>Bob: Alice Uploaded A Recipe
    Bob-->>Server: (HOT) Recipe request
    Server->>Bob: Alice's Recipe (HOT)
```

### Key features

- Users can upload recipes to a server and attach simple word tags that describe it.
- Users can select something they need (e.g. "hot" or "spicy") and the app will randomly cycle through recipes.
- Users can vote on recipes they like (?).
- Maybe instead of weather recipe stuff, you can just as for a random food or give it some general constraints, and it will pull from an API and provide various food items instead of recipes, which you can then research.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.
NOTE: These are drafts.
- **HTML** - Two HTML screens, one for entering a recipe/login and one for viewing recipes
- **CSS** - Simple styling that provides easy viewing. Allows for good recipe formatting on different screen sizing
- **React** - Provides options display (upload/view), shows recipes according to requests
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for (research more!)
- **DB/Login** - Store user ID, recipes, and tags (all associated with each other).
- **WebSocket** - Notification that someone has uploaded/liked a recipe.
