# Hungry?

[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - Used markdown for embedding images, lists, and diagrams
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - a simple description of how users would use the service and how it would benefit them
- [x] Description of key features - the basic features of how users would iteract with the service and how it would operate
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology - Basic information on how each technology will handle their respective features.
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references. - simple sketch of what the pages look like to provide context.

### Elevator Pitch
Sometimes, someone may not know what have for a meal, and they just need some ideas. The "Hungry?" web application helps with this by providing random recipes and meal ideas. Users can upload recipes and attach tag(s) that help describe them, like "hot" or "spicy." Then, users can select a criteria and press a button to get a random recipe. If they don't want to see recipes, they can simply see a random type of food. The principle is to help people get some ideas flowing and provide some starting points for their cooking. People can see what and when others post to help them notice what may be popular or to just provide more ideas.

### Design
Basic concept design. The fundamentals are not complicated.
![Design image](sketch-startup.jpg)

This diagram shows how users will interact with the application and server to deposit and retrieve recipes.

```mermaid

    participant Server
    Actor Bob
    actor Alice
    Alice-->>Server: Alice's Recipe (TAG: HOT)
    Server->>Bob: Alice Uploaded A Recipe
    Bob-->>Server: (TAG: HOT) Recipe request
    Server->>Bob: Alice's Recipe (TAG: HOT)
```

### Key features

- Users can type up a recipe in a text box to be uploaded to the server.
- Users can select a tag to be connected to the recipe. 
- Users can ask for a random recipe with a certain tag, and the app will randomly retrieve a recipe with that tag and provide it.
- The user can then move to another recipe if they do not like the current one. The app will randomly cycle through recipes.
- Provides users with the weather for reference and/or can provide a random foods for brainstorming.
- Users will be notified every time someone uploads a recipe.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.
- **HTML** - Several HTML screens, one for entering a recipe/login and one for retrieving and viewing recipes and foods.
- **CSS** - Simple styling and aesthetic color pallette that provides easy viewing. Allows for good recipe formatting on different screen sizing. Some basic animations for interacting with buttons.
- **React** - Provides options display (upload/view recipes) and routes the user to the recipe/login page and the view recipe page depending on their input. Shows new recipes or foods according to user requests. In recipe upload view, provides login/User ID. Also controls the on-screen notifications.
- **Service** - The application's backend will have endpoints for:
    - Retrieving and depositing recipe data, such as text and tags; specifically, retrieving data that are connected to each other (recipes with a specific tag, etc).
    - Deposit login information/user ID in connection with recipe data
    - Call to API for weather data and/or random foods.
- **DB/Login** - The app's database will store user ID, recipe text, and tags (all associated with each other). This will allow the app to find recipes associated with certain tags and pull them from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The app will provide small notifications whenever someone has uploaded a recipe. It may notify the user that someone has uploaded a reciped with a tag.

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [My server link](https://yourdomainnamehere.click).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - I created two html pages, index.html and find-recipe.html, both for a function of the application 
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I set up each page with an HTML tag, a head and footer, a ```<nav>``` section, and a body section with main. Within main I put in various tags for input, text, buttons, etc.
- [x] **Links** - In the ```<nav>``` section of each html file, I added links to the other html files. There is also a link to the Github repository on each page.
- [x] **Text** - Added title text and descriptive text to provide the user with directions and information. I also provided some placeholder text for some things that would be provided by the server/user.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - An example of a random food was shown in find-recipe.html. When fully implemented, the application will retrieve a random food name from an API and display it here to the user INSTEAD OF a recipe. Both the recipe and the random food are shown for demonstration purposes.
- [x] **Images** - Icons placed in the header that will be formatted with CSS later. Simple food/fall related images.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - ID and password fields in index.html (as an account is only needed to upload recipes, not view them). Buttons to create a User ID or submit one. Placeholder text shows that the application will tell the user welcome to ensure them that they are logged in.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - The Recipe text in find-recipe.html and the login notifier with the username are both placeholder texts for information that will be retrieved from the database. The tags would also be stored in the database and associated with specific recipes, so those would be shown alongside the retrieved recipes.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - The placeholder text in find-recipe.html which reads "User2 just uploaded a COLD recipe!" is a WebSocket component, where it will be a real time notification whenever someone uploads a recipe.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Created a header with an image, two rows of text, and two buttons with links. There is a footer of the same color with a button leading to the github page. There is content in the main part of each webpage, containing recipe text, input fields, and and buttons. The main content body is able to grow while the header/footer stay consistent. Flexbox and bootstrap were used to style the header, footer, and main content body.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - Each page had a header with two link buttons, each leading to one of the webpages of the application. There is a github link in the footer. The link buttons are formatted with bootstrap and some custom styling.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - Each page is built with flexbox, so window resizing is fairly well handled. I added media elements in the CSS to hide the headers and footers at a certain size. When the application is resized, there is empty space at the bottom, allowing for a greater text box/recipe output. Several elements, such as the user-alert paragraphs and #header-bar nav, are set to fill any available space. The body element of each page will expand to fill available space.
- [x] **Application elements** - I used CSS to manipulate many of the HTML elements, including main, nav, header, footer, and some that I ID'd, such as find-input, user-alert, header-text, etc. I used a main.css file to create consistent format between shared elements on the html pages, and then separate css files (upload and find) for more specific and typically HTML main related styling. I altered many of the elements to include bootstrap functionality, such as the buttons, drop-down menus, and input boxes. Flexbox was used to format many of the elements and align them together.
- [x] **Application text content** - The text content is written in a sans-serif font. I formatted it mainly using flexbox. A body element and various other sub-elements use color attributes for the text. In the upload page, the text content consists of titles and input directions. There is example text of a successful and failed login. In the find page, the example text of the random food and recipe and the user-alert have been formatted using flexbox.
- [x] **Application images** - I formatted some small icons to be next to the title using flexbox. I also used bootstrap to format them to have rounded corners.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - I installed vite using npm init and npm install. The git history shows the incremental changes to the project as I installed various components. I also installed various bootstrap and react components via the command line.
- [x] **Components** - Multiple components, including App, Upload, Find, and NotFound. App acts as the main body and includes the header and footer that stay constant. It is rendered by ```index.html```. Upload and Find contain body HTML for those specific functions, as well as a custom part of the header. App, Upload, and Find each have their respective css files, with ```app.css``` also acting as a overall css style for Upload and Find as well. NotFound is a component found in ```app.jsx``` that simply is to render a 404 error.
- [x] **Router** - Router components can be found within ```app.jsx```. The entire body section is wrapped in a ```<BrowserRouter>``` tag, and in the header ```<nav>``` tag there are NavLinks to several directories. Where the ```<main>``` tag would be there is the ```<Routes>``` tag, with three different routes. One is for ```/```, which directs to the Upload component, one is for ```/find```, which directs to Find component, and the other is for any other path, which directs to the NotFound component for a 404.

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - I did not complete this part of the deliverable.
- [x] **Hooks** - In find.jsx, I added a useState for the Random Food button, which has a mocked function for accessing an API on a click.

    To see a full test, enter a user ID and a password and click "Create ID". Note that if you try to sign in with another password, you will be unable too, and if you have a failed login, the recipe data will not be submitted to localstorage even if you hit submit and it clears (see the console). 

    After you have signed in (a green box should show), enter a Recipe Title and some Recipe text, and select a recipe tag. REMEMBER THE TAG YOU SELECT. Hit submit. The fields should clear.

    Then, go to the Find Recipes page. You will see a default recipe. If you click "Random Food", then the recipe will disappear and a random number will appear. This random number is a placeholder for a random
