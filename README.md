# Hungry?

[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - Used markdown for embedding images, lists, and diagrams
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - a simple description of how users would use the service and how it would benefit them
- [x] Description of key features - the basic features of how users would iteract with the service and how it would operate
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology - Basic information on how each technology will handle their respective features.
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references. - simple sketch of what the pages look like to provide context.

### Elevator Pitch
Sometimes, someone may not know what have for a meal, and they just need some ideas. The "Hungry?" web application helps with this by providing random recipes and meal ideas. Users can upload recipes and attach tag(s) that help describe them, like "hot" or "spicy." Then, users can select a criteria and press a button to get a random recipe. If they don't want to see recipes, they can simply see a random type of food. The principle is to help people get some ideas flowing and provide some starting points for their cooking. People can see what and when others post to help them notice what may be popular or to just provide more ideas.

### Design
Basic concept design. The fundamentals are not complicated.

This diagram shows how users will interact with the application and server to deposit and retrieve recipes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Server
    Actor Bob
    actor Alice
    Alice-->>Server: Alice's Recipe (TAG: HOT)
    Server->>Bob: Alice Uploaded A Recipe
    Bob-->>Server: (TAG: HOT) Recipe request
    Server->>Bob: Alice's Recipe (TAG: HOT)
```

### Key features

- Users can type up a recipe in a text box to be uploaded to the server.
- Users can select a tag to be connected to the recipe. 
- Users can ask for a random recipe with a certain tag, and the app will randomly retrieve a recipe with that tag and provide it.
- The user can then move to another recipe if they do not like the current one. The app will randomly cycle through recipes.
- Provides users with the weather for reference and/or can provide a random foods for brainstorming.
- Users will be notified every time someone uploads a recipe.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.
- **HTML** - Several HTML screens, one for entering a recipe/login and one for retrieving and viewing recipes and foods.
- **CSS** - Simple styling and aesthetic color pallette that provides easy viewing. Allows for good recipe formatting on different screen sizing. Some basic animations for interacting with buttons.
- **React** - Provides options display (upload/view recipes) and routes the user to the recipe/login page and the view recipe page depending on their input. Shows new recipes or foods according to user requests. In recipe upload view, provides login/User ID. Also controls the on-screen notifications.
- **Service** - The application's backend will have endpoints for:
    - Retrieving and depositing recipe data, such as text and tags; specifically, retrieving data that are connected to each other (recipes with a specific tag, etc).
    - Deposit login information/user ID in connection with recipe data
    - Call to API for weather data and/or random foods.
- **DB/Login** - The app's database will store user ID, recipe text, and tags (all associated with each other). This will allow the app to find recipes associated with certain tags and pull them from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The app will provide small notifications whenever someone has uploaded a recipe. It may notify the user that someone has uploaded a reciped with a tag.
